## Abstract
Decision-support tools are commonly used to maximize return on investments (ROI) in conservation.
We evaluated how the relative value of information on biodiversity features and land cost varied
with data structure and variability, attributes of focal species and conservation targets, and habitat
suitability thresholds for contrasting bird communities in the Pacific Northwest of North America.
Specifically, we used spatial distribution maps for 20 bird species, land values, and an integer linear
programming model to prioritize land units (1 km2) that met conservation targets at the lowest
estimated cost (hereafter ‘efficiency’). Across scenarios, the relative value of biodiversity data increased
with conservation targets, as higher thresholds for suitable habitat were applied, and when focal
species occurred disproportionately on land of high assessed value. Incorporating land cost generally
improved planning efficiency, but at diminishing rates as spatial variance in biodiversity features
relative to land cost increased. Our results offer a precise, empirical demonstration of how spatiallyoptimized
planning solutions are influenced by spatial variation in underlying feature layers. We also
provide guidance to planners seeking to maximize efficiency in data acquisition and resolve potential
trade-offs when setting targets and thresholds in financially-constrained, spatial planning efforts aimed
at maximizing ROI in biodiversity conservation.
